        <h2>Detecting pneumonia from X-Ray</h2>
        <h3>We are a group of Biomedical Engineering students from UVic that have created a machine 
            learning system which enables the detection of pneumonia from X-Ray images.  </h3>
            <h4>Pneumonia is an infection of the lung that can be caused by multiple microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses and fungis.
                This illness is classified according to wether it is acquired: community-acquired pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia.
                Anyone can get pneumonia, and there are many factors that determine that a person is more susceptible to infection by some microorganisms or others. 
                In developed countries it is the sixth cause of death. Approximately 7 to 15 cases are observed for every 1000 people per year.
                In addition, it is the leading cause of death in children
                An early diagnosis is crucial, since it involves a progressive aggravation that in many cases ends people's life </h4>
